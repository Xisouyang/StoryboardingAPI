# StoryboardingAPI

The **Storyboarding API** allows the user to submit and find different concepts of stories for free. This API sends back JSON with important elements of a story such as plot, conflict, resolution and more.

<!-- will gather you the latest news that is currently going on in the community. This API will respond to you in JSON and provide the headline, publish date, description, image, and more. The best part is that the information will always stay *up to date* -->
